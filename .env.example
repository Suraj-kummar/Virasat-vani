# If you need to add API keys or configuration in the future, add them here
# and reference them in your code using import.meta.env.VITE_*

# VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com

# Note: All environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the app
# Never commit .env files with real values to version control
